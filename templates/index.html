                <p class="p-2 mr-3 text-wrap italic decoration-white">Ancient India was home to a rich arsenal of weapons that played a crucial role in warfare and self-defense. The subcontinent's military advancements included melee weapons such as swords like the Khopesh and the Talwar, which were known for their curved, razor-sharp blades. Spears and lances were also common, used by infantry and cavalry alike. Ranged weapons such as bows, including the legendary Dhanush, enabled archers to attack from a distance, while chakrams—sharp, circular throwing discs—were uniquely Indian. Many weapons were crafted with spiritual and technological significance, often engraved with religious symbols or enhanced through metallurgy techniques that made them more durable and deadly.

                <p class="p-2 ml-3 text-wrap decoration-white">Ancient Indian craftsmanship was renowned for its intricacy, precision, and artistic excellence. Artisans worked with a variety of materials, including wood, stone, metal, and textiles, to create magnificent sculptures, jewelry, pottery, and architectural marvels. The Harappan civilization (circa 2500 BCE) showcased advanced town planning, sophisticated drainage systems, and expertly crafted ornaments made from gold, silver, and semi-precious stones. Metalwork was another significant aspect of Indian craft, with bronze statues and iron tools displaying remarkable skill. The lost-wax casting technique, used in making the Chola bronze sculptures, is a testament to the advanced metallurgical knowledge of ancient Indian artisans.</p>

                <p class="p-2 mr-3 text-wrap decoration-white">Ancient India made significant contributions to engineering and technology, blending scientific precision with artistic excellence. The Indus Valley Civilization (2600-1900 BCE) is a prime example, showcasing well-planned cities, drainage systems, and multi-story buildings, which were far ahead of their time. One of the most impressive engineering feats was the construction of stepwells, which provided sustainable water management solutions in arid regions. These structures, such as the Rani ki Vav in Gujarat, were both functional and beautifully adorned with intricate carvings.</p>
